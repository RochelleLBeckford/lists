            Wrap the sliced tofu slabs in a clean kitchen towel and place a few heavy cookbooks on top to <b>drain the excess liquid</b>. Let it drain for at least 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Afterward, cut each tofu slab in half, then into 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
        <li>
            Place the tofu cubes inn a bowl. <b>Sprinkle with kosher salt, black pepper, and cornstarch</b>.
        </li>
        <li>Toss gently to coat.</li>
        <li>
            Next, <b>heat the oio in a large nonstick frying pan</b> over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, add the coated tofu cubes in an even layer in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fry the tofu</b> until each piece is golden on the bottom.
        </li>
